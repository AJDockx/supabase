We're excited to release an [official Supabase UI Library](https://supabase.com/ui)—a collection of ready-to-use components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Designed for flexibility, these components can be dropped into any Next.js, React Router, TanStack Start, or plain React app.

Installing components from the Supabase UI Library, is as easy as installing a component from shadcn/ui.

<Img alt="Install" src="/images/blog/launch-week-14/day-1-supabase-ui-library/install.jpg" />

The library is 100% shadcn/ui compatible, using the [component registry](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1829646556318089509) feature. It follows the conventions for theming and reuses existing components like buttons and inputs.

Our UI registry is a collection of reusable components designed for use in several popular React various React frameworks. Components are styled with shadcn/ui, styled with Tailwind CSS, and are completely customizable.

It's designed to take both the time and the pain out of building complex functionality like user sign-up in your apps. All components work with new or existing projects.

## What's included?

- [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/client) initialization for client-side and server-side use
- [Password-based authentication](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/password-based-auth)
- [File Upload Dropzone](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/dropzone)
- [Real-time Cursor Sharing](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/realtime-cursor)
- [Current User Avatar](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/current-user-avatar)
- [Realtime Avatar Stack](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/nextjs/realtime-avatar-stack)
- [Realtime Chat](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/tanstack/realtime-chat)

We intend to release more Supabase UI Library components, and we'd love to get your feedback. Got a favourite component you want for your applications? Let us know on [X](https://x.com/supabase) or [Discord](https://discord.supabase.com/), or we'd be happy to get a [pull request](https://github.com/supabase/supabase).

Let's look at some of the components.

## Password-based authentication

Setting up authentication in your projects can be complicated and time-consuming. The Password-Based Authentication block provides all the necessary components and pages to implement a secure, user-friendly authentication flow in your projects in seconds. It includes sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and forgot password pages.

## Easy file uploads

The File Upload Dropzone component lets you add file upload and storage in your application in seconds. It features drag-and-drop support,
multiple file uploads, file size and count limits, image previews and MIME type restrictions.

File upload components are often complicated to set up. Spend your time working on what happens after the files are on the server.

## Realtime cursor sharing

The Realtime Cursor component gets you started building multiplayer experiences in your applications. You can just drop this component into your project, create a new room via your Supabase Dashboard, and you're ready for realtime in seconds.

It features real-time, low-latency updates, message synchronization, message persistence support, customizable message appearance, automatic scroll-to-bottom on new messages and more.

## Why build on shadcn/ui?

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has been the [top project](https://risingstars.js.org/2024/en#section-all) on JavaScript Rising Stars for two years running—and for good reason. It offers a unique approach: instead of installing a component library as a dependency, you copy and paste the actual component code into your project. You get complete control over customization, styling, and behaviour, with components that feel like part of your project.

## Get started today

Skip the boilerplate and long setup times—focus on what really matters: building and shipping fast. Explore the Supabase UI Component Library, drop it into your projects, and let us know what you think. Be sure to reach out and tell us what components you want to see next!
