Supabase is a [Platform as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) that can be managed programmatically. You can use it to offer services to your own users. Supabase is commonly used as a platform for AI Tools, agents, and vibe-coding companies.

This document will guide you on best practices when using Supabase as a PaaS.

## Getting started

All features of Supabase can be managed through the [Management API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) or the [MCP Server](/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp).


### Launching projects

- Launch an new project
- [Docs: Create a project](https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/projects/POST/v1/projects)

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "db_pass": "",
  "name": "",
  "organization_id": "",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "desired_instance_size": "pico",
  "template_url": "https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/slack-clone/nextjs-slack-clone"
}'
```

## Development workflow

Supabase is a _stateful_ service: we store data. If anything breaks in production, you can't simply "roll back" to a point in time because doing so might cause your users to lose any data that their production enviroment recieved since the last checkpoint.

Because of this, it's important that you adopt a development workflow on behalf of your users:

![Change flow](/docs/img/integrations/change-flow.png)

After launching a Project, it's important that all changes happen on a Branch. This is because branches can be treated like ephemeral servers: if anything goes wrong you can either revert the changes or destroy the branch and create a new one from production.

### Creating a development Branch

- Create a branch
- [Docs: Create a branch](https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/environments/POST/v1/projects/{ref}/branches)

```
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/branches \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "branch_name": "",
  "git_branch": "",
  "persistent": true,
  "region": "",
  "desired_instance_size": "pico",
  "release_channel": "internal",
  "postgres_engine": "15",
  "secrets": {
    "ANY_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTY": ""
  }
}'
```


### Make a change

- TODO
- https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/database/POST/v1/projects/{ref}/database/migrations

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/database/migrations \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "query": "",
  "name": "Create a todo table"
}'
```

### Merge all changes

- TODO
- https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/environments/POST/v1/branches/{branch_id}/merge

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/branches/merge \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "migration_version": ""
}'
```

### Delete the branch

- TODO
- https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/environments/DELETE/v1/branches/{branch_id}

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/branches/ \
  --request DELETE
```


## Making changes


## Database changes

Database changes are handled through migrations.


### Edge Functions

You can develop Edge Functions on a branch and then merge them into Production.

![Deploy Edge Functions](/docs/img/integrations/change-functions.png)

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/functions/deploy \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form 'file=' \
  --form 'metadata={"entrypoint_path":"","import_map_path":"","static_patterns":[""],"verify_jwt":true,"name":""}'
```

### Configuration

You can manage the configuration of all services using the Management API. This includes Auth configuration like enabling and disabling SSO Pro


### Reverting changes

- TODO

![Revert](/docs/img/integrations/revert.png)


## Disaster Recovery

- Rollbacks can cause data loss. Only use in in `PROD` when absolutely necessary

![Rollback](/docs/img/integrations/rollback.png)


Supabase creates continuous backups of production branches. To rollback you can use the [Restore API](https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/database/POST/v1/projects/{ref}/database/backups/restore-pitr):

```sh
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/database/backups/restore-pitr \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "recovery_time_target_unix": 1
}'
```
