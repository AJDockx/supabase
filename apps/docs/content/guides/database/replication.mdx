title: Database replication
description: Replicate your data to external destinations
---

Postgres comes with built-in features for replication, which helps you copy your data to other destinations. When you use replication, changes in your source database are automatically synced to one or more destinations. For example, you can sync a table to a data warehouse, or your entire database to a read replica.

Choose the data syncing method based on your use case:

1. For realtime features, see [Realtime](/docs/guides/realtime)
2. For read replicas, see [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas)
3. For syncing data to an external destination, see [`pg_replicate`](/docs/guides/database/replication/pg_replicate)
4. For syncing data to a custom external destination, see [Manual Replication](/docs/guides/database/replication/manual-replication)

## Use cases for replication

Replication serves several important purposes:

- **Analytics and Data Warehousing**: Replicate your operational database to analytics platforms like BigQuery for complex analysis without impacting your application's performance.
- **Data Integration**: Keep your data synchronized across different systems and services in your tech stack.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Maintain up-to-date copies of your data in different locations.
- **Read Scaling**: Distribute read operations across multiple database instances to improve performance.
